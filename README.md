This is only a host to load the GoldHen Payload.
Use this at your OWN risk, No modifications were done to the Goldhen Payload By [SiSTR0](https://github.com/SiSTR0)
Its more of a fun personal project. It's not meant to replace any big hosts out there.
While it does work, I wouldn't reccomend depending on this site for quick updates.
